# 1. Introduction to the Course
## Learning Objective
 Students will understand the strengths and weaknesses of different types of databases and data modeling techniques

# 2. What is Data Modeling
"...an abstraction that __organizes elements of data__ and __how they__ will __relate__ to each other" -- Wikipedia

Data modeling can easily translate to database modeling, as this is the essential __end state__

Data modeling can easily be called database modeling

## Data modeling
- Process to support busines and user applications
- Gather REquirements
- Conceptual Data Modeling
- Logical Data Modeling
- Physical Data Modeling

### overview
In this course, we will focus on The __physical data model__ to create DDL's in __Relational__ and __Non_Relational databases__
(DDL => Data Definition Language)

# 3. Why is Data Modeling Important?
- Data organization is critical
- Organized data determines later data use
- Begin prior to building out application, business logic, and analytical models
- Iterative preocess

# 4. Who does this type of work?
Data Modeling is an important skill for :
- data scientist
- software engineers
- data engineers
- anyone involved in the process of using and analyzing data

# 5. Intro to Relational Databases
## Relational Model
"This model __organizes data into__ one or more tables (or __relations) of columns and rows__, with a __unique key identifying each row.__
Generally, each table represents one __entity type__"

RDBMS (Relation DataBase Management System)

- Database/Schema
  - Collection of Tables
- Tables/Relation
  - A group of rows sharing the same labeled elements
- Columns/Attribute
  - Labeled element
- Rows/Tuple
  - A single item

# 6. Quiz: Relational Databases
- True or __False__: A column holds multiple tables.
- __True__ or False: An attribute is another name for a column.
- __True__ or False: A schema is a collection of tables in some database terminology.
